# linera_algebra_final
Program that calculates different functions of linear algebra equations

Program that calculates a bunch of different equations and solutions for a 2x2 2D matrix.
It takes user input for each value. An example of the program running will be shown below.

In order, the program calculates:
 - Transpose of the matrix
 - Inverse of the matrix
 - Determinant of the matrix
 - Reduced row of the matrix
 - Rank of the matrix
 - Trace of the matrix
 - Eigenvector of the matrix
 - Eigenvalues of the matrix
